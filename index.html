        <h1> Welcome to my page!</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone, My name is Eric Penn and I am currently training as a developer learning the big three coding necessities: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I plan on taking whatever I learn during this 14-week period to further my Business Analyst skills so I can pinpoint what client needs and how to better translate those requirements into app and programs.</p>

<article class="Education"> 
    <h2>My Education</h2>
    <p>I have spent the majority of my life learning in Georgia. My alumni is Georgia Southern University which I currently have a Bachelor's of Management Information Systems in. I started in August 2010 and graduated May 2014 with around a 3.4 GPA. During my tenure at GSU, I became familiar with the Enterprise Resource Planning software SAP (Systems Applications and Processes) which is a German Database basically that an enormous amount of companies use to simply their day to day activities. I ended up enduring a two-week long bootcamp to obtain a TERP10 certification saying that I understood mainly the relationships between the various modules in SAP.

<article class="JobHistory">
        <h2>My Work History</h2>
        <p>I was one the lucky students who had a job right out of college mainly thanks to the TERP10 certification from SAP and I ended up working as an SAP Consultant. My official job title was Business Analyst but you could say I specialized in SAP environments/implementations.

    <h3>Traveling Abroad</h3>
    <p>I have traveled abroad to India to further my SAP studies and learn quite a bit about the culture of offshore teams and environments that push a ton of the work in SAP. I spent a month abroad learning cultures, work loads, best practices and anything you could think of that might randomly come up in a project team meeting with offshore.
